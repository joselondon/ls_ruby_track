`!` Can be used in the following ways: -

* A comparison operator (NOT) eg `!true == false`

* Can also be used at the end of a method name to indicate that the method is destructive eg `[1,1,2,3].uniq!` 

`?`
  * can also be used at the end of a method name to indicate that the method returns a boolean `true` or `false` eg `is_a?`

  * can also be used as a ternary `if`

1. `!=` => ***'Does not equal'*** comparison operator to determin if the values of two operands are equal<br>
<br>
2. `!user_name` in this case `!` is equivalent to the `NOT` logical operator.  ie `user_name == false`<br>
<br>
3. `uniq!` in this case `!` at the end of a method name indicates the method is destructive to the caller.<br>
<br>
4. `?` before something would potentailly be using the ternary conditional operator but only in conjunction with `:` without the colon `?` will return an error
